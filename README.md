### Unmaintained
This repository is unmaintained as I do not own a Kraken anymore. If this doesn't work for you or it doesn't fulfill your needs, it's best to look for other forks or solutions. though I may still answer questions. 

# camctl
Fan/pump speed control on Linux for NZXT Kraken X62 (possibly other editions)

# DISCLAIMER
Use at your **own risk**, I take **NO** responsibility if anything crazy happens. Neither does NZXT as they are not involved.

With that said however, this is basic stuff - nothing crazy has happened in my testing, and I can't think of a reason why anything bad could happen.
